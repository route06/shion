## Motivation

I've seen a lot of chatbot applications, but most of them use Langchain, and Langchain requires python, so it was a bit cumbersome to deploy.
I wanted to create a chatbot that works in an edge environment like Cloudflare Pages.
This application is a clone of ChatGPT, and requires only JavaScript no python so it can be deployed on edge environment like Cloudflare Pages.

## What is the name Shion?

Shion is a name of an AI from the anime Sing a Bit of Harmony(Japanese:「アイの歌声を聴かせて」).

In the movie, she searches for ways to make her human friends smile. I named this app after her in hopes that humans and AI can coexist in the future like in this movie.
